# Dusty

A featherweight testing framework for JavaScript.

Dusty is designed to be super easy to use for the developer who wants to dip their toes into testing.

She has 3 matchers:
`isEq`, `isTrue` and `isFalse`.

Her tests are organised in `describe` and `it` blocks.

### Installation

```
$ npm install dusty-testing
```
### Use
```
$ cd node_modules/dusty-testing
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

To give you a flavour of how Dusty works there are currently a few default tests written in `noteSpec.js`.

When you write your own tests, don't forget to update the `src`'s at the bottom of `SpecRunner.html`.
